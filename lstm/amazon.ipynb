This is musically complex punk with a lot of influences and a lot of tight playing and gripping tunes.\\n\\nThis is an awesome concert. The only two problems are that 1) it is just 67 minutes long and 2) John Doe\\'s bass is buried too deep in the mix.\\n\\nEvery X fan should get this. More importantly, anyone who doesn\\'t know about X should get this.\\n\\nWhy X? Did you know, for example, that:\\n- X has a different sound based on the unique harmonies between co-lead singers Exene Cervenka and John Doe that really sets them apart from anything else out there?\\n- Doe, Cervenka and drummer DJ Bonebrake also play in the country punk band The Knitters?\\n- Billy Zoom, the guitarist who originally formed the band, used to play rockabilly guitar for Gene Vincent and other big stars, and has been voted one of the greatest guitar players ever by Guitar Player magazine?\\n- X were playing Leadbelly tunes way before Kurt Cobain?\\n- Ray Manzarek, keyboard player of The Doors, produced X\\'s first four albums? This is one of the big reasons why the band covered and generally closed its concerts with \"Soul Kitchen\" from the album&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/The-Doors/dp/B000MCIBE8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">The Doors</a>\\n- Cervenka and Doe used to be married, before Exene later married Viggo Mortensen -- Aragorn from the Lord of the Rings movies?\\n- Billy Zoom left the band from the mid-1980s to the mid-1990s, but during this time the band still managed to record&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/X-Live-at-the-Whisky-a-Go-Go/dp/B000005IRW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">X Live at the Whisky a Go-Go</a>, one of the greatest live rock albums ever, with guitarist Tony Gilkyson?\\n\\nAs this DVD proves, X is still as good as ever. Billy Zoom still plays standing in his trademark splayed-leg stance with a broad grin on his face. Did I say he is awesome? Awesome.\\n\\nI waited way too long before getting this one, thinking I could do without an X DVD. And I could have. But why should I? This really is worth it, and I\\'m sure I\\'ll be putting this one in the player more often than a lot of my other music DVDs. Really, really good.', 'overall': 5.0}]\n"
