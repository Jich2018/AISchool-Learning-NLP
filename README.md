Prerequisite: 
- Python > 3.7,  
- pip > 20.2.0,  
- virtualenv (install by 'python -m pip virtualenv')

1. create a virtual environment by command 'virtualenv venv'
2. activate the venv '.\venv\Script\activate.bat'
3. restore the dependency 'python -m pip install -r requirements.txt'
4. download necessary corpus  
python -m nltk.downloader averaged_perceptron_tagger  
python -m nltk.downloader punkt  
python -m nltk.downloader treebank  
5. go to Azure, find out the CosmosDB account (nlp-movie-data), copy/paste the cosmos endpoint and cosmos key to the NLP_COSMOS_ENDPOINT and NLP_COSMOS_KEY in config.py. (The running_in_cloud condition is for Azure, to run in local, paste the value in else part)
6. start the service in local by running 'flask run', this will start a web server on localhost:5000. also can start the service by just running 'python app.py', however this will start the web service in a different way as what Azure does, you might see different result or error by starting in this way.
